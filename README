This script does a t-sne visualization of popular action recognition/localization datasets to understand their similarities. 
An average 50-D embedding is obtained for each dataset/action from word tokens appearing in ground-truth action labels.

Prerequisite:
1. 50-D Glove embedding: https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/
2. Download t-sne from the below path and include to the python path:
